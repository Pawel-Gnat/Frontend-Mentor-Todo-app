## My process

Firstly I created an a initial html structure with empty state information and styled it. Then I implemented my JS functions that allowed me to manipulate with my html elements. At the end I created a local storage and drag and drop functionallity. I also tried to refactore my code a little and make it easier to read and understand.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I needed 41 hours to complete this app. I learned how to create drag and drop function, keep tasks in a local storage, create, read and delete new elements.
